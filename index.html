      <h1>Jeremy the Human</h1>
      <p>
		Whether Jeremy was born a human or raised as a human is one of the many questions I ask myself when
		 looking at his piece of paper with Chinese characters.

		 Toast can be a great breakfast food, however I have noticed that my palate 
		 has gotten quite sensitive due to the rough texture. Similar to the stubble 
		 of men but with much less testosterone and more tes<b>toast</b>erone. I believe 
		 that toast may be the answer to the mystery that is Jeremy the Humans heritage, 
		 perhaps his bloodline stems from toast. This could potentially be the reason 
		 to Jeremy's stubble.
